They can also view their personal information such as name, registration ID and degree ID.</p>\n<h3>Teachers</h3>\n<p>Teachers are able to view student information for modules that they teach. This includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Student name</li>\n<li>Modules taken by the student</li>\n<li>Initial mark achieved from that module</li>\n<li>Resit mark</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Teachers can also add or edit initial marks and resit marks. Teachers are able to automatically generate a weighted mean grade after finishing a module they have taught and added marks for.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"21/01/2024","path":"/admin-system/","title":"Uni Admin System","skills":["Java","JavaSwing","MySQL"],"weblink":"https://github.com/Sangie50/Security-and-Design-Team-project"}}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
