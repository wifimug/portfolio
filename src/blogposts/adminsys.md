I built an administration system for teachers and students to track students' degree progress across multiple modules. There are four types of users: the admin, the registrar, the teacher and the student.

### Students
 Students are able to view their modules and their grades in the modules, after they complete 3 or 4 year degrees, they can view their degree certification. They can also view their personal information such as name, registration ID and degree ID.
 

### Teachers
Teachers are able to view student information for modules that they teach. This includes:
- Student name
- Modules taken by the student
- Initial mark achieved from that module
- Resit mark

Teachers can also add or edit initial marks and resit marks. Teachers are able to automatically generate a weighted mean grade after finishing a module they have taught and added marks for.
